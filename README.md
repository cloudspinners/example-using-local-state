_This repository is a messy work in progress, not intended to be used for real._

I'm using this repository to work out a standard project structure for infrastructure projects. It uses a Rakefile to manage infrastructure instances. I have drawn on [InfraBlocks](https://github.com/infrablocks) for Terraform modules, and I used the [InfraBlocks ConcourseCI](https://github.com/infrablocks/end-to-end-concourse-ci) project as a starting point for this one.

This particular repository is a stripped down to use local state. It's intended to introduce the project structure.
